# Step 1.
Take back the class recordings to review together with my annotations in order to start writing the code.

# 2nd Step. 
There were times when the code was not executing what I needed in the table (in all the work sheets and coming out with the correct results) so I went to Ask BCS (Chris LA Team) several times to reconfigure the code.

# 3rd Step. 
I looked at internet sources like StackOverflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21918166/excel-vba-for-each-worksheet-loop) and Chat GPT (https://chat.openai.com/c/13edaa2f-d07d-402e-9546-bac71a9e37d8) to work out details of the code.

# 4th Step. 
At the end, the details were that the code did not close or was in the wrong order (I know that the results of Increase and Decrease are not the same as the reference image of the module, I tried to modify it and did not reflect the expected result, I am learning, I would appreciate if you could let me know what I failed in the code, work on it and to analyze the correction within the code, thank you).
